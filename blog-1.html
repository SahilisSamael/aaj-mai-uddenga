            <p>So today at <b>MidNight</b>, I am writing this blog and I am very excited about it. Because this is my first blog on my website. I always wanted this. My own place on “The Internet”, where I can write whatever I want. I don’t like getting censored. This is the main reason why I chose to write here, instead of structuring my rant into 280 character on twitter, or even on Blogger, so to have a Sense of Freedom. <br> Internet is an amazing place, It changed my life. I don’t want to go deep on Internet situation. Since this is my first blog, this is going to be completely topicless.</p>

            <div class="border">
            <titletext>>> What's the deal here? </titletext>
            </div>
            <p>This blog is just a part of my website and I have intentions to manage this website/blog my whole life. This way I can document my life and thoughts, and people can know me even after I die. I want to make it public, since I have some issues interacting with people and making friends. People can know me without even contacting me.</p>
            <p>If you have no interest in my life, well here I will also write about tech and other stuff I learn, so those articles can be useful for you. <br> I believe my blogs will be highly informal. If I end up in some bad day/mood. I might write some really nasty stuff. Lets hope this never happen. <br> I also want to improve my English writing skills. Seems like a great way to do it. <br> I hate writing on garbage social media platforms (example - facebook, twitter, quora). Here I will feel more free and my words don’t get mixed with noise</p>

            <p>I want to make this clear, I am not good with English. So don’t expect good literature from me. I write in exact same manner I speak. I would love to -get corrected so if you find any spelling mistake or grammar mistake please contact me.</p>

            <p>I visited Richard Stallman Personal Website and I love it. He is my true inpiration. The way he right against non free softwares, it motivated me to do the same. <br><b>On this blog I will write about..</b> <br> My life. <br>Free Software. <br>Hate speeches for non free softwares <br> Places I might visit in future <br> Anything new I explore <br> Movies / TV shows <br> My Opinions about random events <br> It can be anything so this list is stupid</p>
